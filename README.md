# Professional Portfolio

This project compiles my various projects and learning excersises into a professional portfolio.

Intended use:
Present my work in an organized manner for prospective employers to review.

Thought process in development as a portfolio object:
The layout of the page was originally part of an Odin Project assignment to replicate the design of a generic landing page using HTML and CSS.
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page -
https://vidorr.github.io/odin-landing-page/
I repurposed that format for my protfolio with intention to refactor it as needed.

I decided to store my project data in a JSON file. This will allow me to easily add to the list of projects and add enhanced search/filter options later.

For now I am still considering this project incomplete.
